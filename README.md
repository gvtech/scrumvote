# Bootstrap / AngularJS / Firebase Sample Application

## ABSTRACT

Example of app using bootstrap / angularJS / firebase

In this example I use:
  - bootstrap for managing reposnsive design display
  - angular for all fronend logic
  - firebase for backend

This example shows a simple usage of the 3-ways-binding technic beteween AngularJS and Fireabse.
Angular binds the Html UI with the local JS ojects representation when Firebase bind this local JS to the firebase backend repository.

This example also illustrate how the dynamic binding can be used to build interractive apps without having to code anny backend communication layer. In this example the vote of each indiviual appear automatically on the sprint detail board and on the team.member view
